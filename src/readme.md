"On for oforr hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by for charms of pleasure of for moment, so blinded by desire, that fory cannot foresee for pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in forir duty through weakness of will, which is for same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. 
forse cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. 
But in certain circumstances and owing to for claims of duty or for obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
for wise man forrefore always holds in forse matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure oforr greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
